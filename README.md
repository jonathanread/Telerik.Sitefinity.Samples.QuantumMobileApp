# QuantumMobileApp
The app is out of the box is hooked up to a public sitefinity instance and will work as is but we incourouge you to setup your own instance for testing.

## Install the newest version of the Quantum website
https://github.com/Sitefinity-SDK/Telerik.Sitefinity.Samples.Quantum

## Install NativeScript by following the steps from here 
https://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-win

## Setup Emulator(s)
Android (windows/mac) https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html

iOS (xCode) https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

## Host the Qantum website on your IIS

## Open the app.js file of the mobile app and configure the endpoints
global.ServiceEndPoint = "http://192.168.152.142:4774/"; //should point to your localhost 

global.ServiceEndPointWS = "http://192.168.152.142:4774"; //the same address like the above without the slash

keep in mind that http://10.0.2.2:89 or http://10.0.3.2:89 is your localhost because of the VM and the emulator.
In case that you want yo access another machine from your intranet use the IP instead of the machine's name.
If using android emulator authenticating against localhost(10.0.2.2) it requires you to use your machine's IP address NOT the adroid emlulator local address '10.0.2.2'

#### *Important:* In order to get New's and Blog's Categories you need to make a small change in Sitefinity's ***quantum-mobile*** web service settings.
1. In Sitefinity's backend go to "Administration -> Settings -> Advanced".
1. Then go to "WebServices -> Routes -> Frontend -> Services -> quantum-mobile -> Type".
   * Go to "Telerik.Sitefinity.News.Model.NewsItem -> Property mappings -> Category" and check the "Selected by default" checkbox and save the change.
   * Go to "Telerik.Sitefinity.Blogs.Model.BlogPost -> Property mappings -> Category" and check the "Selected by default" checkbox and save the change.
   * Go to "Telerik.Sitefinity.Libraries.Model.Document -> Property mappings -> Category" and check the "Selected by default" checkbox and save the change.

## Authentication Setup
1. In Sitefinity's backend go to "Administration -> Settings -> Advanced".
1. Then go to "Authentication -> "

## The app is using [Progress Sitefinity Digital Experience Cloud](https://docs.sitefinity.com/dec) for tracking and content personalization. In order to enable it you need to do the following:

1. Log in to [Digital Experience Cloud](https://dec.sitefinity.com/) web application.
1. This app using the demo data center in the DEC
1. Go to your Data center through the Administration panel and get the Api key and the Authorization token.
1. Uncomment and fill in the following code in app.js
```js
var decApiKey = '<please enter the apikey of your datacenter here>';
global.DecClient = new DecClient({
    apiKey: decApiKey,
    source: 'QuantumDecDemo',
    authToken: 'appauth ' + decApiKey
});
```
The app will work without setting up the Digital Experience Clound but there will be no tracking or personalization of content.
If using android emulator authenticating against localhost requires you to use your machine's IP address NOT the adroind emlulator local address '10.0.2.2'
